            "text": "Came here as a belated anniversary dinner. (Seems like everyone comes here to celebrate their anniversary!) It's in a bit of an odd location, and at first we didn't realize we had arrived because the exterior doesn't really scream \"upscale restaurant.\" \n\nWe ordered off of the Prix Fixe menu (choose three courses for $75 or four courses for $85). I got three courses and my boyfriend got four, so that we could split the dessert.\n\nI had the Hamachi Tartar, Salsify Soup, and the Beef Tenderloin. All three courses were absolutely delicious and had me savoring each bite. In particular, it really surprised me how much I enjoyed the soup. They also gave us plenty of delicious amuse-bouches between courses. As for the dessert, we ordered the Soufflé Grand Marnier. My boyfriend really liked it, but I couldn't really handle the hints of alcohol that I could taste in it. (I'm not a huge fan of alcohol.) \n\nService was really, really on top of things. Basically any time my glass had room for more water, it was refilled. They did a wonderful job explaining each course to us, and when my boyfriend asked for a wine recommendation the waiter was really knowledgeable about what would pair well. (They also have a sommelier.) The most amusing part was when I got up to use the bathroom and the servers all parted to let me through. Got me feeling really important for a few seconds..\n\nThe ambiance is very quiet and upscale. The interior is nicely decorated, and the corner that we were seated in had wine bottles lining the wall. \n\nOverall, my boyfriend and I thought Le Papillon was well worth the price. Unlike other upscale restaurants that charge you a lot and give you very small portions, everything here was sizable and we left super full. We also thoroughly enjoyed every dish we ordered, and we weren't disappointed at all.",
